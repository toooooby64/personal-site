		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I'm Jason, a Software Engineer at Amazon where I work on high-scale distributed systems in the
			price publishing pipeline. The prices you see on Amazon.com? I work on the systems that decide
			them. No, I can't change the price of that thing you've been eyeing (I mean… let's talk…
			offline)*
		</p>
		<p>
			But honestly, the job title is just the latest expression of something I've always been: a
			builder. I've been pulling things apart, putting them back together, and making new things out
			of the pieces for as long as I can remember. These days that shows up in production systems at
			Amazon and in whatever side project has taken over my weekends.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're here because you're hiring, looking to collaborate, or just want to talk shop — I'm
			glad you stopped by.
